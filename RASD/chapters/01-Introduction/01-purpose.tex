The COVID-19 causes many challenges to our society. For the agriculture, it has greatly highlighted the massive disruption caused in food suppl y chains exposing the vulnerabilities of marginalized communities, small holder farmers and the importance of building resilient food systems. In addition, climate changes also impact everything from productivity to livelihoods across food and farm systems and is predicted to result in a 4\%-26\% loss in net farm income towards the end of the century. Therefore, it is important for us to develop innovative methodologies and technologies that can help bolster countries against food supply shocks and challenges.\\
This is why we develop DREAM, an application helped not only farmer, but also agronomists and policy makers to work together so that they can stabilize their food supply.\\
The goal of this document is to show a fully system description about the main goals, functionalities and scenarios, then going more into details describing the functional and nonfunctional requirements that the system should be fulfill.
