\subsection{Product}

DREAM is an organic system of policy producers, agronomists and farmers to solve farmers' land yield problems, report problems to policy makers, agronomists and get feedback, and DREAM is also a forum among farmers.\\ \\
DREAM allows policy producers to go into the data reported by farmers to rank them and thus identify those farmers who are performing well, especially if they show resistance to adverse weather events, as these farmers will be specially rewarded and asked to provide useful best practices to other farmers. Identify those farmers who need help because they are performing particularly poorly. Find out if the mentoring initiatives carried out by agronomists with the help of good farmers have produced significant results.\\ \\
As for farmers, DREAM can visualize data relevant to them based on their location and type of production - for example, weather forecasts, personalized advice on planting specific crops or using specific fertilizers. DREAM can also allow farmers to insert information about their own products as well as post problems they are having and allow them to ask for help from agronomists or other farmers.
