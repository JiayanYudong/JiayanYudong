\subsection{Constraints}

In order to improve the ease of use of the system, all users will not authenticate to the system. For all the functionalities that require to know the identity of the users, the system will use:


\begin{itemize}
    \item when users access the system with an IT device, a device identifier that the system generates and binds to the device itself
    \item when users access the system with a standard telephone line, the caller identifier of the telephone line (telephone number)
\end{itemize}

For the authentication of policy makers, instead, the system will integrate with identity systems.
