\subsection{Hardware interfaces}

Policymakers need to have an Internet-enabled IT device to access the DREAM system for management. Farmers need GPS-enabled mobile devices to locate the managed fields and to access the weather conditions of their areas from the Internet. 

Also, the corresponding farmland should have a moisture detector to detect soil moisture. The detector should have Internet capability to transmit monitoring data back to the software in real time. The detector can be powered by a mobile power source such as a battery, as it is difficult to achieve a fixed power source in a farm field.

\subsection{Software interfaces}

The weather forecast function is very important in order to help farmers to better improve their production. The software provides an API to obtain weather forecasts for short and long term weather forecasts provided by Telengana website. 

In the mean time, the system should provide an external interface to provide location services to determine the location information of the user's farm. The client should remind the user of all the APIs used in the system during the registration process.
