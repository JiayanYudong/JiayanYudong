DREAM is an organic system of policy producers, agronomists and farmers to solve farmers’ land yield problems, report problems to policy makers, agronomists and get feedback, and DREAM is also a forum among farmers.  To reach such an objective, the scalability and the usability of the system are taken into account when defining:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The system architecture, which should scale well with the rate of adoption of the system.
  \item The user experience, which should be effective for people of all ages and conditions.
  \item The testing of all the system’s components and of the system as a whole, to guarantee an adequate level of quality.
\end{itemize}
