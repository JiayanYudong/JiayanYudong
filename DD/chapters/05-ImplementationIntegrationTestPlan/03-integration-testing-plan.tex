\subsection{Overview}

A component should be unit tested as soon as it is implemented; if necessary, a driver can be used in place of components that are not yet completely built. As a result of selecting a bottom-up method in the implementation phase, we should also select a bottom-up strategy for integration and testing. After a component's unit tests pass, it is integrated into the system and integration testing is performed: every interface that the component utilizes is tested. Due to the usage of a bottom-up method, this process concludes when the components at the top of the hierarchy are incorporated into the system. At that time, system tests may be used to test the entire system.

\subsection{Plan}

\begin{enumerate}

	\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}

	\item At first, the DBMS API has to be tested, in order to check for misconfiguration and correctness of the interface.

	\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
		
	\item  Then, the implementation goes on for Farmer, Policy Maker and Agronomists:

	\end{minipage}

	\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
	
	\item Then, Requests, Registration and Information components  are  integrated and tested.

	\end{figure}

	\end{minipage}

	\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
	
	\item Later, the implementation of Results, Daily plan and its integration with Suggestion Service can begin.

	\end{minipage}

	\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
		
	\item Later, the implementation of the connection with web server will begin.

	\end{figure}

	\end{minipage}

	\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
		
	\item Then,  after  the  deployment  of  the  Web  Server  component,  its  integration  in  the  whole  system  is tested.

	\end{figure}

	\end{minipage}

	\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
		
	\item 7. Finally the interface view and controller components services will integrated and tested.
